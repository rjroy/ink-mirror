# Daemon-First Architecture Pattern

The daemon is the application. Everything else is a client.

Web, CLI, and agents don't make decisions or hold state. They relay user intent to the daemon and render what comes back. If the daemon stops, there is no application. If a client stops, nothing is lost.

## Three Clients, One App

| System | Stack | Role |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Daemon** | Hono on Unix socket via `Bun.serve()` | The application. Owns all state, logic, and coordination. |
| **Web** | Next.js App Router (server + client components) | Read-only UI. Calls daemon REST API for writes. |
| **CLI** | Plain bun scripts | Discovers operations from daemon at runtime. No built-in catalog. |

The daemon runs on a Unix socket (or TCP for cross-platform). Web and CLI never touch the filesystem, config, or internal state directly.

### Why CLI Matters

The CLI isn't a convenience interface. It's what makes the daemon usable by other agents.

An agent with shell access can discover what the daemon offers, invoke operations, and read results without a custom client library. The operations registry and runtime discovery serve this directly: agents learn the surface the same way humans do.

**When you make a thing, you make a CLI.**

## Daemon Internals

### Route/Service Split with DI Factories

Every route file is a factory: `createXRoutes(deps) → RouteModule`. Each factory receives only the slice of dependencies it needs. Production wiring lives in one place, which builds real deps and passes them down.

```typescript
type RouteModule = {
  routes: Hono;
  operations: OperationDefinition[];
};
```

Tests provide mock deps. The app can start with a fallback if production setup fails.

### One Entry Point for SDK Calls

All LLM interaction flows through a single session runner. No direct SDK calls from routes, services, or domain logic.

The runner handles session preparation (tool resolution, prompt assembly, model selection) and iteration (streaming events back to the caller). Callers describe what they need. The runner decides how to talk to the SDK.

This isn't about abstraction for its own sake. When SDK calls scatter across the codebase, every caller reinvents error handling, streaming, and tool resolution. One entry point means one place to fix, observe, and evolve.

## Operations Registry and CLI Discovery

Routes export `OperationDefinition` objects with hierarchy metadata. The registry builds a navigation tree.

```typescript
interface OperationDefinition {
  operationId: string;          // "project.status.get"
  name: string;                 // "get"
  description: string;
  invocation: { method: string; path: string };
  requestSchema?: ZodType;
  hierarchy: { root: string; feature: string };
  parameters?: OperationParameter[];
  idempotent: boolean;
}
```

CLI fetches the tree from `/help` endpoints. Progressive discovery:

```
mycli help                    → Full tree
mycli project help            → Subtree
mycli project status get      → Operation details
```

The CLI binary contains no operation catalog. The daemon is the source of truth.

## EventBus and SSE

Simple set-based pub/sub. Services emit events on state transitions. SSE route streams events to the browser (or any client that listens).

Socket idle timeout must be disabled (`idleTimeout: 0`) for long-lived SSE connections.

## State Model

All durable state is in YAML and markdown files. No database.

Humans can inspect and edit state files directly. This is a feature, not a limitation. When something goes wrong, you open a file and read it.

## Type Boundaries

- **Shared types** live in a common package. Never import from daemon or web packages.
- **Daemon types** stay in the daemon. Branded types (e.g., `ProjectId`, `SessionId`) prevent mixing ID namespaces at compile time.
- **Web types** derive from API responses, not from daemon internals.

## Testing Seams

DI factories are the primary testing seam. Every external dependency is injectable:

- `queryFn`: Mock LLM responses (return test event generators)
- `gitOps`: Mock git subprocess calls
- `recordOps`: Mock file I/O
- `createLog`: Inject collecting or null loggers
- Hono's `app.request()` test client with injected deps
- `fs.mkdtemp()` for temp directories, env vars for path isolation

Export interfaces, not concrete implementations. Concrete types are internal; public contracts are interfaces.

Never `mock.module()` (causes infinite loops in bun). Design for dependency injection instead.
